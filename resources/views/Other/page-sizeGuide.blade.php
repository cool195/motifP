                <p class="m-b-20x">While the most precise way to find your ring size is to have a jeweler do it,

                    do it at home. Whether you're sizing your finger to buy a ring online, or
                    want to surprise
                    your
                    sweetie with an engagement ring, the next method has you covered.</p>

                        <li>Cut a strip of paper or a piece of string. Wrap the paper or string around the
                            finger to be sized.
                        </li>
                        <li>Slide the paper or string up to the knuckle, as the ring must be sized large enough
                            to able to slip off and on, over the knuckle.
                        </li>
                        <li>Mark the intersection point of string. Make sure to mark both points of the
                            string.
                        </li>
                        <li>Place the paper or string next to a ruler and write down your measurement.</li>
                        <li>Locate your ring size by locating your measurement on the size chart.</li>

                <p class="m-b-20x">
                    If the measurement falls in between two sizes, it is recommended that you choose the larger
                    size. Your fingers might also swell if you're pregnant or taking certain medications. Take
                    this
                    into account when measuring your fingers.
