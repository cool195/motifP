                then in effect. Unless otherwise
                agreed by the Disputing Parties in writing, the arbitration shall be held, and the
                award shall be issued in, Los Angeles, California. The arbitration shall be
                conducted before a single arbitrator, who shall be neutral and independent of the
                Disputing Parties. The arbitrator shall be selected by an agreement between the
                Disputing Parties, except that if the Disputing Parties are unable to agree within
                twenty (20) days after the arbitration commences, the arbitrator shall be appointed
                as provided in the Rul.</p>
            <p>The Disputing Parties intend to preserve their rights under any
                applicable law to seek and obtain provisional relief from any court of competent
                jurisdiction to the extent necessary to preserve the status quo pending the
                appointment of the arbitrator or to protect meaningful relief in the arbitration.
                Once appointed, the arbitrator shall have full authority to grant provisional
                remedies and to direct the Disputing Parties to request that any court modify or
                vacate any temporary or preliminary relief by such court, and to award damages for
                the failure of any Disputing Party to respect the arbitrator’s orders to that
                effect.</p>
            <p>Any arbitration proceeding to enforce, confirm, modify or vacate a
                decision or award rendered hereunder shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration
                Act, 9 U.S.C. §1 et seq. In arriving at a decision, the arbitrator shall be bound by
                the terms and conditions of this Agreement and shall apply the governing law of this
                Agreement without regard to conflicts of law principles. The arbitrator shall award
                the prevailing party all reasonable costs, expenses and attorneys’ fees incurred in
                connection with the arbitration proceeding. The award, which shall be in writing and
                shall state the findings of fact and conclusions of law upon which it is based,
                shall be final and binding on the parties and shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
                between the parties regarding the issues submitted to arbitration. Judgment may be
                entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
            <p><strong class="sanBold">The parties involved in the Dispute expressly intend and
                    agree that class action, collective action and representative action procedures
                    shall not be asserted, nor shall they apply, in any arbitration pursuant to
                    these Terms; that neither party shall assert a class, collective or
                    representative claim against the other, in arbitration or otherwise; and that
                    each of the parties shall submit only its own, individual claims to arbitration
                    and will not seek to represent the interests of any other person.</strong></p>
