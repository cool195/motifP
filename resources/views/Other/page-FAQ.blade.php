                <p class="m-b-0">Option 1. Registered Airmail (7-20 business days)</p>

                <p>As for Registered Airmail, the Logistics website may not update so frequently, therefore we suggest
                    you check the status after 3-5 days of receiving the tracking information.</p>
                <p>How can I track my order?</p>
                <p>We will send one order confirmation email to you after you complete your purchase. When your package
