    <h2 class="helveBold text-main font-size-lxx m-b-20x m-x-20x">Privacy Policy</h2>
    <div class="bg-white content box-shadow section-box">
      <p class="sanBold m-b-15x">SECTION 1 - WHAT DO WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION?</p>
      <p>When you purchase something from our store, as part of the buying and selling
        process, we collect
        the personal information you give us such as your name, address and email
        address.<br>
        When you browse our store, we also automatically receive your computer’s
        internet protocol (IP)
        address in order to provide us with information that helps us learn about
        your browser and
        operating system.<br>
        Email marketing (if applicable): With your permission, we may send you emails
        about our store,
        new products and other updates.</p>

      <p class="sanBold m-b-15x m-t-20x">SECTION 2 - CONSENT</p>
      <p>How do you get my consent?<br>
        When you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction,
        verify your credit
        card, place an order, arrange for a delivery or return a purchase, we imply
        that you consent to
        our collecting it and using it for that specific reason only.<br>
        If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like
        marketing, we will either
        ask you directly for your expressed consent, or provide you with an
        opportunity to say no.</p>
      <p class="m-t-20x">How do I withdraw my consent?<br>
        If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent for
        us to contact you,
        for the continued collection, use or disclosure of your information, at
        anytime, by contacting
        us at service@motif.com or mailing us at:<br>
        <a href="#" class="text-underLine text-primary">Motif</a><br>
        <a href="#" class="text-underLine text-primary">160 Greentree Drive, Suite #101, Dover, DE
          19904.</a>
      </p>

      <p class="sanBold m-b-15x m-t-20x">SECTION 3 - DISCLOSURE</p>
      <p>We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so
        or if you violate
        our Terms of Service.</p>

      <p class="sanBold m-b-15x m-t-20x">SECTION 4 – PAYMENT</p>
      <p>If you choose a direct payment gateway to complete your purchase, then
        Motif.me stores your
        credit card data. It is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data
        Security Standard
        (PCI-DSS). Your purchase transaction data is stored only as long as is
        necessary to complete
        your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction
        information is
        deleted.<br>
        All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed
        by the PCI
        Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa,
        MasterCard, American
        Express and Discover.<br>
        PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card
        information by our store and
        its service providers.</p>

      <p class="sanBold m-b-15x m-t-20x">SECTION 5 - THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</p>
      <p>In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and
        disclose your
        information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services
        they provide to
        us.<br>
        However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and
        other payment
        transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the
        information we are
        required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.<br>
        For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you
        can understand the
        manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers.<br>
        In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have
        facilities that are
        located a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to
        proceed with a
        transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider,
        then your information
        may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service
        provider or its
        facilities are located.<br>
        As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed
        by a payment
        gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in
        completing that
        transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation,
        including the Patriot
        Act.<br>
        Once you leave our store’s website or are redirected to a third-party website
        or application,
        you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of
        Service.</p>
      <p>Links<br>
        When you click on links on our store, they may direct you away from our site.
        We are not
        responsible for the privacy practices of other sites and encourage you to
        read their privacy
        statements.<br>
        Google analytics:<br>

        and what pages are
        being looked at.</p>

        destroyed.<br>

        encrypted using secure
        socket layer technology (SSL) and stored with a AES-256 encryption. Although
        no method of
