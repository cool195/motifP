Shipping time for pre-order/personalized pieces may take longer, details of which can be found in the product description.

                                <p>Our system is currently setup in a way that each attempted checkout is viewed as a separate order. If you cancelled the payment process during the checkout process, your incomplete order will be moved to your “Orders” page within your Motif profile, along with all the items that you were trying to order, and any applied promo codes. You can view your order history and choose to complete any cancelled order there.

                                <p>Your order can also be cancelled if your payment is declined by your bank, credit card company, PayPal, or Apple Pay. If you wish to place the order again, simply place the order again through by signing in to your Motif profile, click “Orders”, and select the order you wish to process.

                                <p>In rare cases, the item you ordered may have became out of stock and is no longer available. If an item in your order does become unavailable, you will be contacted within 24 to 48 hours regarding the cancellation. If your order contains additional items, these items will still be shipped to you and only the unavailable item will be removed from your order.

                                <p>Most payments are declined due to billing information entered not matching the address your bank has on file. Please be sure to check that your payment details match what your bank has on file, and if that still does not work, please send us an email at service@motif.me and we will try our best to help.

                                <p class="avenirBold"><span>Why does it look like I was charged more than once?</span></p>
                                <p>Unless you received an order confirmation, we did not charge your card. If your credit card was declined, you may see pending transactions for each attempt to submit a payment. This is a common bank practice handling credit card transactions to ensure sufficient funds and account authenticity. The pending transaction will clear up within 3-5 business days, depending on your bank, and will never turn into a charge. You will always get an email confirmation for every charge that we make, when an order is successfully placed on our site.
