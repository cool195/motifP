                <p class="sanBold"><strong>1. What kind of personalization services do you offer?</strong></p>
                <p>For now, we only offer engraving service. There will be an engraving box on
                    the Personalized
                    Products detail page.</p>

                <p class="sanBold"><strong>2. Is personalized jewelry more expensive?</strong></p>
                <p>Not really, we offer personalization service and you can find all the
                    personalized jewelry in the
                    personalized category. We will only charge a couple of dollars for the
                    personalization
                    workmanship.</p>

                <p class="sanBold"><strong>3. What characters can be engraved?</strong></p>
                <p>Dates, names, words, and simple patterns can all be engraved.</p>

                <p class="sanBold"><strong>4. What part of rings, necklaces and bracelets can be
                        engraved?</strong></p>
                <p>Please note that engravings can only be done on the insides of rings and
                    bracelets and on the
                    backs of pendants.</p>

                <p class="sanBold"><strong>5. How many characters can be engraved?</strong></p>
                <p>In order for the words to be legible, please keep the number of characters
                    within 15.</p>

                <p class="sanBold"><strong>6. How long it will take to process personalized jewelry?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Personalized items usually take up to 7-15 days as we do need time to meet
                    your
                    specifications.</p>

                <p class="sanBold"><strong>7. Can you make a ring, necklace or bracelet if I just give you a
                        picture?</strong></p>
                <p>Yes, we can make jewelry according to pictures you send to us and your other
                    requirements, and we
                    will do our best to meet your specifications.</p>

                <p class="sanBold"><strong>8. Can I return it if I don’t like it?</strong></p>
                <p>Sorry, personalized jewelry cannot be returned unless it’s a quality issue.
                    Because personalized
                    jewelry is made according to your requirements, once it has been made it
                    cannot be sold to
                    others.</p>

                    Normally our service team will reply within24 hours, but during the busy season or
                    long holidays,
                    it may take longer to respond. However, no emails will be left unanswered.</p>
